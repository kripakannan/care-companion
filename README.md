CareCompanion is an all-in-one platform designed to empower family caregivers and healthcare providers by simplifying real-time health tracking and medication management for elderly patients requiring around-the-clock care. Through an intuitive interface, it centralizes patient health records, medication schedules, and therapy plans, while also connecting caregivers with local support groups, educational resources, and symptom management tools. CareCompanion alleviates caregiver stress, promotes collaboration with healthcare professionals, and ensures better patient outcomes, particularly in suburban and rural areas with limited resources.
